# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

**Domain**: Telecom Analytics  
**Tech Stack**: Python | Machine Learning | Scikit-learn | Seaborn  
**ML Type**: Supervised Classification  
**Level**: Intermediate → Industry-Ready  


Customer churn is one of the most critical business problems in subscription-based industries like telecom.
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to churn, enabling companies to take proactive retention actions before revenue loss occurs.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to model building, evaluation, and business interpretation.

##  Business Problem
Acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones.
By accurately predicting churn, companies can:

* Reduce revenue loss
* Improve customer retention strategies
* Optimize marketing and customer support efforts

##  Solution Approach

1. **Data Understanding**

   * Analyzed customer demographics, services, and account information
2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handled missing values
   * Encoded categorical variables
   * Scaled numerical features
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Identified churn patterns and key influencing factors
   * Visualized correlations and distributions
4. **Model Building**

   * Trained multiple ML models
   * Compared performance using evaluation metrics
5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy
   * Precision, Recall, F1-score
   * Confusion Matrix
6. **Insights & Recommendations**

   * Identified high-risk churn segments
   * Suggested business actions

##  Key Insights

* Customers with **short tenure** have a higher churn probability
* **Month-to-month contracts** are more likely to churn
* Higher **monthly charges** increase churn risk
* Long-term contracts significantly reduce churn
